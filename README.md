# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```



The stack
In this guide, we will build out a full stack application using:

Web application framework - Next.js
Solidity development environment - Hardhat
File Storage - IPFS
Ethereum Web Client Library - Ethers.js

Though it will not be part of this guide (coming in a separate post), we will look at how to build a more robust API layer using The Graph Protocol to get around limitations in the data access patterns provided by the native blockchain layer.

About the project
The project that we will be building will be Metaverse Marketplace - an NFT marketplace.
